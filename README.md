# CG-Scale
Based on https://github.com/nightflyer88/CG_scale. Work in progress to port to ESP32. Uses PlatformIO IDE with VS Code and Arduino framework.

The development board used is a AZ Delivery ESP-32 Dev Kit V2. The pinout used in ESP32.h refers to my current breadboard prototype design.

The current version is working. Scale functionality, WiFi connectivty and web server tested. Not tested so far: OTA update, supply voltage measurement.
